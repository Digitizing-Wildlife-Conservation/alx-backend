The "alx-backend" repository houses fundamental backend projects organized by topic folders such as pagination algorithms, caching techniques, and internationalization (I18n) and localization (L10n). Each folder corresponds to a distinct project exploring these topics through Python and JavaScript programming languages. The repository serves as a documentation hub for these core backend projects, providing structured insights and implementations in both languages.
