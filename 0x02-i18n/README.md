This project involves learning to write unittests and integration tests in Python 3 using the parameterized module. Two tasks were completed: writing a unit test for utils.access_nested_map with various inputs and implementing a test to check for exceptions. Both tasks use the TestAccessNestedMap class, which inherits from unittest.TestCase, and apply @parameterized.expand for testing different scenarios.
