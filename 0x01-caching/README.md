0x01. Caching Back-end Cohort


This project involves learning different caching mechanisms through the implementation of various caching systems in Python. It includes three tasks: creating a basic dictionary-based cache with no size limit, implementing a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) cache that discards the oldest item when the cache exceeds a predefined size limit, and developing a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) cache. Each task requires extending the BaseCaching class, utilizing its self.cache_data dictionary, and implementing put and get methods to manage cache operations while handling edge cases such as None values.
